Subcultural theories discuss how crime and deviance can be caused or not caused by several factors relating to the unique norms and values of certain individuals. It discusses how the macro that includes behaviours of society as a whole and micro to analyse the behaviours at an individual level can lead to prolonged or political crime/deviance.


### Cohen
Cohen's study states that crime in young men is due to a failure in reaching society's goals, therefore resorting to things such as theft to achieve material wealth. He calls this state of being 'Status frustration' similar to what are described as NEETs. However, he also argues that this frustration is not only for material gain, but also frustration with society itself as evidenced by acts such as vandalism or destruction of goods. He claims that this is a result of failure at school, causing the boys to search for another form of validation in the form of a gangs. Within such gangs they develop a strong set of gang values, which are values opposed to those of the greater society. 

### Evaluation
Cohen's view on crime and deviance prove beneficial as it can explain crimes that don't have clear motives. It is also useful when evaluating group crimes as a whole, helping to describe the shared subcultural behaviours in criminal gangs. However, Cohen's view falls short in several different fields, for example it refuses to acknowledge the existence or behaviours of female criminal gangs, only explaining male lead gangs. Although, Miller would disagree as he claims that men commit crime to prove masculinity instead of proving trying to gain social status. Functionalist Murray would agree with Cohen as he argues that this type of crime is causes by the rise of NEETs searching for external validation as they fail to do so through traditional methods within education or employment.
