Anomie is a term used to describe a person who has developed a sense of normlessness caused by improper socialisation or due to the strain of society as theorised by sociologist Merton. He argued that situations that lead to excess stress due to failure to achieve material gain can lead a person down a path of crime and anomie. The etymology of the term itself comes from the Greek word "nomos" for law with the prefix "a" meaning without forms the word "anomie" or "to be without law". The term itself was coined by the functionalist thinker Durkheim who took its lawless definition from the Greek language and adapted it with the French spelling to label those who lack accepted social norms and values. Contemporary examples include the London riots in 2011 where individuals took the city by storm with violent, large scale riots. The initial media coverage caused an uprise of people who saw it as an advantage and joined the riots, developing what could be called anomie through means of deviancy amplification. The term deviancy amplification was coined by Wilkins in 1967 then later expanded upon by Cohen in 1972 who related it to a deviancy amplification spiral evidencing it with the, at the time, recent quarrel of two large subcultures called the "mods" and the "rockers". His study shows that through media coverage, those who had ideas that aligned with the groups developed a newfound motivation to take part in the uprising.
