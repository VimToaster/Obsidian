# Wilson rational choice theory
- Crime is the result of rational calculation
- If people see the benefits of committing a crime are worth more than the consequences and/or costs, they are more likely to break the law, especially if they believe that they will not be caught
- Offenders are not qualitatively different to non-offenders, nor do they have any differing backgrounds that can explain the reason for their offence#
	- + Interactionalist
	- - Functionalism
- For example, while many people form poor, deprived backgrounds commit crimes, many more do not. People make choices about their behaviour that are neither determined nor necessarily influenced by their social and/or psychological backgrounds
- Choices are made in the context of situations, particularly the opportunities that are available for the commission of crimes.
