# Wilson rational choice theory - broken windows
- Crime is the result of rational calculation
- If people see the benefits of committing a crime are worth more than the consequences and/or costs, they are more likely to break the law, especially if they believe that they will not be caught
- Offenders are not qualitatively different to non-offenders, nor do they have any differing backgrounds that can explain the reason for their offence#
	- + Interactionalist
	- - Functionalism
- For example, while many people form poor, deprived backgrounds commit crimes, many more do not. People make choices about their behaviour that are neither determined nor necessarily influenced by their social and/or psychological backgrounds
- Choices are made in the context of situations, particularly the opportunities that are available for the commission of crimes.

# Cohen - Routine Activities theory
- In most circumstances, social control, lack of opportunity and/or the risk of getting caught prevented crime from taking place therefore crime needs three conditions to take place
	- Motivation to offend
	- Availability of opportunity
	- Lack of capable guardians
- Most crime was opportunistic, rather than planned in advance
	- Therefore if individuals had motivation and means, they would spring at the chance to commit crime
- ## Criticisms
	- Rests on a theory of the 'economic man' who is constantly looking for opportunities to maximise his personal gains
	- This theoretical man is purely such, a person without the regularities of real people such as a past or a social life. Instead just muddles through life looking for opportunities

# Murray
- Family structure was responsible for much of the increase in the crime rate in the 70s and 80s
- Blamed it on a growing underclass
	- The underclass is a group within society that consisted of NEETS, people who aren't in education, employment or training.
- He argued that these people fail to socialise their children properly
- The group had increased due to a rise in welfare dependency
- This lead to the decline of marriage and increase in lone parent families who depend on the state
- This lead to men not having a reason to work due to a lack of family
- Murray argues that mothers are ineffective agents of socialisation, especially for boys
- Absent fathers leads to lack of parental discipline and appropriate male role models

# Controlling Crime
- Employ two main techniques of crime control
	- Situational
		- Focus on making adaptations in localities, e.g. locked windows or ring doorbells
		- Based on ideas of rational choice theory
		- Increasing surveillance
			- By the mid 1990s, 78% of the Home Office's crime prevention was spent on CCTV
			- By 2013 there were an estimated 4.5 and 5.9 million cameras in the UK
			- Only 1/70 cameras are publicly owned
		- Target hardening
			- Makes it harder to break into places and objects harder to steal
			- Examples include spiky railings and anti-climb paint
			- 
	- Environmental
		- Focuses on areas as a whole through more intense policing who adopt a 'Zero Tolerance' policy to minor crimes
- Situational crime focuses on micro whereas environmental crime focuses more on macro
