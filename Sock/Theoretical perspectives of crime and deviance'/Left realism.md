# Young (1997)
- [[Square of crime.canvas|Square of crime]]
- Argues that we must be tough on crime
	- Not only criminals, but also social factors that can lead to crime
	- Ensure that police enforcement promotes justice rather than punishment
- He argued that after the second world war, an increase in living standards and the existence of the welfare state has resulted in higher crime rates
- Three of the main factors that cause crime are
	- Relative deprivation
		- The feeling of inferiority compared to people portrayed in the media results in people feeling subordinate to those in higher classes, leading to crime as a means to minimise the feeling of depravity
	- Marginalised
		- People of lower class status feel marginalised by society. For instance people feel bored when the monotony of unemployment bears down on them too much.
		- They perceive that the only way to influence politics is through crime.
	- Subcultural membership
		- Many working-class subcultures are anti-authority or antagonistic of the police (ACAB, BLM, etc.).
		- This develops as a response to the poor social conditions, for example, young West Indian men turned to Rastafarianism, therefore resulting in a higher cannabis consumption


# Kinsey et al
- Policing system has many flaws
- Do not spend enough time investigating crime and therefore some crime is left unnoticed
- Relies on public reports
	- Due to lack of trust in the system, people are less likely to report crime
- Resort to "Military policing" resulting in more invasive policing techniques, further helping to lessen the support in the system
- Kinsey argues that the police need to change their technique to regain public trust
	- Spend more time investigating crime
	- Public should have more of a voice when creating legal policies
		- Online safety act (2025)
		- Police can't police themselves
