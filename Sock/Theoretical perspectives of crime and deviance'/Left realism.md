- Argues that we must be tough on crime
	- Not only criminals, but also social factors that can lead to crime
	- Ensure that police enforcement promotes justice rather than punishment
- He argued that after the second world war, an increase in living standards and the existence of the welfare state has resulted in higher crime rates
- Three of the main factors that cause crime are
	- Relative deprivation
		- The feeling of inferiority compared to people portrayed in the media results in people feeling subordinate to those in higher classes, leading to crime as a means to minimise the feeling of depravity
	- Marginalised
		- People of lower class status feel marginalised by society. For instance people feel bored when the monotony of unemployment bears down on them too much.
		- They perceive that the only way to influence politics is through crime.
	- Subcultural membership
		- Many working-class subcultures are anti-authority or antagonistic of the police (ACAB, BLM, etc.).
		- This develops as a response to the poor social conditions, for example, young West Indian men turned to Rastafarianism, therefore resulting in a higher cannabis consumption
