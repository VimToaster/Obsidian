# Key ideas
- Rejects the positivistic notion of deviants simply reacting to external forces
	- Looks at interaction between deviants and those who define them as deviant
		- i.e. interaction between deviants, parents, teachers, doctors, police, judges and probation officers
	- Recognises meanings are not fixed and clear-cut


# Goffman
- Social labels effect out perception of people, e.g. a 'stigma'
- Defines a stigma as an "attribute that is deeply discrediting"
	- General thesis is that stigma is a form of deviance tat leads to judge individuals as illegitimate for participation in an interaction
- Identified three main types of stigma:
	- 1. Stigma associated with mental illness
	- 2. Stigma associated with physical deformation
	- 3. stigma attached to identification with a particular race, ethnicity, religion, ideology etc
- Non stigmatised treat those with social stigma as the 'other'
- People distance themselves from the stigmatised groups which can lead to hate crimes

# Becker
- Crime is a consequence of labelling and discrimination against certain groups
- What makes a person a deviant is not based on what is done but how people react to the actions committed
- No interest into what causes people to begave in a deviant way, instead he is interested in why people choose to label acts as deviant and what effects the label has on the individual.
- People react differently to the same act depending on social context
	- For example; in most cases murder is treated as a serious crime, however in war, the act of killing is highly normalised
- 'Deviance is not a quality that lies in the behaviour itself, but in the interaction between the person who commits the act and those who respond from it'

# Cicurel
- 'Typical delinquent'
- The idea is a social construct, not an inherent reality
- delinquency is not defined by the act itself but the social reaction to it
- Key arguments regarding the 'typical delinquent' include
	- Typification and stereotypes: Law enforcement officials and other agents of social control operate with 'typification' - common-sense theories or stereotypes - about what a typical delinquent is like. These typification often associate delinquency with certain appearances, demeanours, and backgrounds
	- Differential treatment: Based on the typification, police and probation officers are more likely to scrutinize, arrest, and charge individuals who fit their stereotypes
	- Justice is negotiable
	- Official statistics are socially constructed: he argued that official crime and delinquency statistics do not accurately reflect the true extent of deviant behaviour
	- Focus on societal reaction emphasises that 'delinquency' is created by societal reaction. Focus should not be on inherent characteristics of the 'delinquents' but on the processes through which individuals become labelled as such.
