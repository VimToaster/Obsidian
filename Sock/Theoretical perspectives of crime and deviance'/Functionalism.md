# General Ideas
- Crime is beneficial
- Looks for sources of deviance
- Durkheim was the pioneer of Functionalist views on crime

# Durkheim
- Analysis of social order and how stability is created in the face on individualism
- Basic ideas include
	- Deviance is a positive way to re-enforce the rights and wrong of society
		- e.g. LGBTQ/female voting rights
	- Deviance provides work
- Possible collapse of society if views are not constantly re-affirmed
- Coined the term "Anomie"
	- A sense of normlessness or social instability
	- e.g. London riots
- "Society of saints" - Even in a perfect society, there will still be acts that can be seen as deviant
- Limited crime is necessary, but too much is harmful
- He argues since change is necessary, so is crime

# Merton
- Strain theory
- People commit crime due to strain
- Success is linked to material and financial gain, therefore people steal to increase their own wealth
- The goal of material success is part of the American dream
- Strain to anomie
	- Anomie is caused by the pressure to accomplish
	- People turn away from legitimate means of achieving material success and take up crime as a way to achieve it
- Merton's 5 reactions to strain
	- Conformity
		- People continue to try and achieve their goals through legitimate means, through conforming to society's norms and values, e.g. working hard to get a promotion at work
	- Ritualism
		- People give up on their goals but still continue to go through the motions of life, in a ritual like fashion, e.g. just turning up to work everyday
	- Innovation
		- People realise they will not achieve their goals through legitimate means, so innovate their means (often criminally) to achieve them. E.g. robbing a bank, rather than working in one.
	- Retreatism
		- People give up on their goals, reject any means to reach them and so retreat from mainstream society. e.g. dropping out of work and becoming a drug addict.
			- People don't really decide to abandon work one day and decide "I'm going to get addicted to drugs"
	- Rebellion
		- People reject society's goals and the means of achieving them, so rebel against society. e.g. dropping out of work to engage in terrorist activities.
			- Same argument as above.
- Evaluation
	- Strengths
		- Discusses why some people don't commit crime
		- Explores working class crime and looks at the root cause as catalyst
	- Weaknesses
		- Not everyone has the same goals
		- Not the only reason people commit crime
		- Society has become more individualistic
		- Marxist - Doesn't take into account the other social classes
		- Doesn't consider other motivators such as political motivation
		- Messerschmidt - Ignores masculinity in crime


# Overall evaluation
- Positives
	- Durkheim paved the way for other theories to build upon his own
	- Right realist Charles Murray would agree as he uses his theory on a deviant underclass to argue that lower classes commit more crime due to social and material deprivation
	- Practical examples such as homosexuality can be used to support these theories
	- Formed the basis for [Subcultural explanations](Subcultural%20theory)
	- Hirschi's ideas are useful to explain why people don't commit crime
