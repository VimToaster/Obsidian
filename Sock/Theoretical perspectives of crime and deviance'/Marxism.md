## Willem Bonger
- Applied Marx's study in Europe
	- Capitalist society brings out **egoism** and selfishness within people
	- Egoism served as an indirect cause of criminal or deviant activity. However it is **Not** directly responsible for crating a criminal
	- Instead it is the environment which the capitalist system creates that makes people more egotistic
		- Peoples intersocial relationships are weakened and people pursue self-interest
- In alignment with selective law enforcement, Bonger argues that the poor's egoism is labelled as criminal often as a result of their lower position in the class hierarchy 
- 79% of criminals he studied came from a non-profitable class which highlights the relationship between poverty and crime
- 2 reasons people commit crime, physical need and want.

## Gordon
- Crime is inevitable as capitalism is "Crimogenic"
	- 'Dog eat dog'
	- This means that the nature of capitalism lays the groundwork for crime
	- This is illustrated in four ways
		- Capitalism is characterised as class inequalities. He suggests that most working-class crime is a rational response to this inequality.
		- Ideology of capitalism encourages criminal behaviour in all social classes. People see crime as an alternative way to achieve their goals
		- The hierarchal nature of capitalism and inequalities in wealth and income encourage non-economic crimes. Those at the bottom of the economic ladder may experience strong feelings of subordination. Therefore crime is a way to compensate for the humiliation of their economic failure
		- Lack of job satisfaction and power at work may result in alienation who compensate for this by exaggerating their power in sexual and domestic fields such as rape and domestic violence

## Box
- What is defined as a serious crime is ideologically constructed.
- Crimes such as property crime and violence are treated as serious crimes among lower classes
- However, upper classes that commit crimes such as environmental crimes that put many more lives at risk are not considered as such
- Even crime such as murder can be ambiguous, for example, deaths due to negligence are not considered as such

		- Hisashi Ouichi
	- Negligence lead to a torturous death and no one was convicted, only compensation was distributed
