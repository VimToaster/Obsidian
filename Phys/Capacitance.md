Capacitors are an electrical component made from 2 parallel conductive plates, separated by some distance. To charge a capacitor, a potential difference needs to be applied across the 2 plates. When used in a circuit, positive charge accumulates on one of the plates as a current is applied, however due to the gap it can travel no further. The opposite is happening on the other plate causing a build up of negative charge. Each plate will always have an equal and opposite amount of charge.

# Equations table

### $V=Ed$ 
### $C= \frac Q V$
### $U= \frac {QV} {2}$
### $C=\frac {\epsilon_0A}{2}$ 
### In parallel $C_{tot}=C_1+C_2+C_3$
### In series $\frac 1 {C_{tot}}=\frac 1 {C_1} + \frac 1 {C_2} + \frac 1 {C_3}$
### Discharging $V=V_0e^{\frac t {RC}}$ -Same for Current and charge
### Charging $V=V_0(1-e^{\frac {-t}{RC}})$ -Same for charge, not for current
### $I=I_0e^{\frac {-t}{RC}}$
