- Gravitational fields are always attractive
	-  $F= \frac {Gm_1m_2} {r^2}$
	- Newton's law describes how forces between two point masses depends on the size of each mass#

- Force is proportional to the square of the distance between them
	- $G=6.67 \times 10^{11}$
	- G is the gravitational constant
	- This equation applies only to point masses. These are objects where all mass is concentrated to a single point
- Gravitational field strength or $g$ is given by
	- $g=\frac {GM}{r^2}$
- Gravitational potential $V$ at a point is the work done per unit mass when moving an object from infinity to that point

- Gravitational potential at infinity is zero, therefore when an object moves from infinity to a point, energy is released and therefore the equation is negative
	- $V=-\frac{GM}{r}$ (For a radial field)
	- M is the mass of the object causing the field and r is the distance between the centres of the objects
- Gravitational potential *energy* is taken by multiplying the previous equation by the object's mass
	- $V= -\frac{GMm}{r}$
- Gravitational potential difference($\Delta V$) is given by the equation
	- $Work\space done = m\Delta V$
- Equipotential surfaces are areas of equal potential joined together, on a diagram this looks like a circle around the object emitting the field
- When moving along an equipotential surface, the work done is zero

- This graph shows the relationship between gravitational potential and radius.
- The gradient of this graph being g
- Because field strength, the final rearranged equation gives us
	- $g\Delta r = -\Delta V$
	- In situations where g is constant, e.g. Earth, we can use this equation to say that $\Delta r$ is equal to the height of the object. Therefore the potential of the object will change by $gh$
		- $\Delta U_p = mgh$
		- Where $U_p$ is potential energy

# Electric fields
- Negative fields attract and positive repel
	- Negative people need attention
	- Positive people give it
- Coulombs law
	- Force experienced by two points is proportional to the product of their charges
	- They are also inversely proportional to the square of the distances between them
		- $F=\frac {1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} = \frac {Q_1Q_2}{r^2}$
		- Where $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space
		- $Q_1/Q_2$ are the charges
		- and $r$ is the distance between the charges
- When using the formula above, air can be treated as a vacuum
- Charge is assumed to act at the centre of a sphere
- Charges with the same sign repel and opposites attract
- The magnitude between subatomic particles is magnitudes greater than the magnitude of gravitational forces
- Electric field strength ($E$)
	- $E = \frac FQ$
	- $E = Vd$
		- For uniform fields formed by parallel plates
	- $E = \frac {1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac {Q}{r^2}$
		- For radial fields
