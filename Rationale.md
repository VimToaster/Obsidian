My reasoning behind choosing this topic lies in how I believe that our classical computers will only be able to take us so far as we tend towards tolerances in the micron level, requiring more roundabout and expensive methods of manufacturing. However, due to the nature of quantum computers, they can not only have the possibility of being even smaller, but also have completely new ways of computational arithmetic. This poses an interesting topic as the technology is still in early development and therefore several studies and technologies are still being pioneered.
