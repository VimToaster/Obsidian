# Quantum physics
## Basics
Quantum physics is an area of study relating to subatomic particles and their interaction with the world. If you're thinking "Why do we need a whole area of physics for just some small particles." Well, because subatomic particles are quite strange, and you'll certainly see why.

First off, what makes subatomic particle so different? Well, at a point where the particle's wavelength becomes comparable to the size of the system they are interacting with. For example, a photon is really small so it obeys the laws of quantum theory. Meaning everything you know about the usual motion of objects goes straight out the window.

First, lets take the double slit experiment first conducted by Young, T., 1804.  _Experiments and calculations relative to physical optics_. Royal Society of London., in this experiment, when a wave passes through the two slits, the wave splits in two on the other size and it interacts with it causing an interference pattern.

So, according to this, light is a wave right? Well, yes and no. In this experiment, photons will act as a wave. However, Einstein, A., 1905. Über einem die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt. _Annalen der physik_, _4_. then came along and conducted an experiment to prove something called the photoelectric effect. In this experiment, you shine some light at a surface and electrons are ejected, so in this experiment, they act like particles knocking electrons out of place. Also, this only occurs at a certain wavelength of light called the threshold frequency. Using this experiment, we get the equation E=hf where h is the Planck constant. Planck, M., 1900. Ueber das Gesetz der Energieverteilung im Normalspectrum, von Max Planck.  _Ann. d. Phys_,  _4_, pp.553-563. In this study, he explored how the energy within a quantum particle can only take certain discrete levels called "energy levels". Further on, our modern explanation for why this is comes from Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrodinger.

So, we now now that light can behave as both a particle and a wave. But why? Well, here is where the great mind of Werner Heisenberg comes in. In his study (Add ref), he discussed the wave function and the uncertainty principle. In his study he shows that there is a certain limit to the accuracy of predicting the position and momentum of a particle withing a system, basically saying that the more accurate we can predict one, the accuracy of the other suffers. For example, if we have a particle confined within a box, we can accurately predict the location of the particle. However, according to Heisenberg, we can therefore not accurately find the momentum. From this he derived the equation $\sigma _p \sigma _x \ge \frac {\hbar}{2}$. This equation basically means that the standard deviation of both the position and momentum must be less than the reduced Plank constant($\hbar = \frac {h}{2\pi}$). So this shows that the more accurate one is, (Smaller standard deviation) the larger the other must be (larger standard deviation).

This image is showing his uncertainty principle in action. where as the red dots get closer together, the blue dots get further apart when relating to the same particle, with the inverse happening below. The red and blue waves are the result of the real and imaginary components of the wave function as it is a complex number.
