### Basic understanding

From what I understand, a quantum computer has qubits. Theis means, where a traditional computer has bits that can be either 0 or 1 (on or off respectively). A quantum computer's qubits can be anywhere between 0 or 1. This is extremely useful due to the nature of quantum particles as they can be in all states between 0 and 1. So, using the logic of quantum physics, we can manipulate the particles such that they result in our desired outcome.

Or at least in theory, in reality it has proved incredibly difficult to isolate a quantum qubit as it cannot have any outside interactions, or at least highly minimalised. This is because any interaction, such as another particle colliding with it will cause quantum decoherence (Wavefunction collapse causing noise in data). 

We can manipulate the probability of these quantum qubits using a wave that interacts with the particle in such a way where the superposition alternates between its exited and unexcited form, we can use this information to manipulate the outcome of the particle in some way. 

To do this they manipulate the waves produced by the particles such that the desired outcome is produced by constructive interference between superpositions of other quantum particles.
