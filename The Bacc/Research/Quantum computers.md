### Analyse the current situation regarding quantum computers
- How much is being invested
- What are the recent developments

An article written by Forbes last year gave some insight into the global spending on quantum computers, stating that global investments reached $55 billion the main contributor being China with an estimated $15 billion invested. For comparison, the UK's military budget is around 60 billion for the financial year, this shows that research on quantum computers is relatively high interest, being comparable to the financial support of a top 10 military power. Furthermore, France has said that they aim to invest $2 billion and create 30,000 jobs by 2026. The quantum computer market as a whole has an estimated worth of about $1billion.

This article goes into depth on a project announced by China where they are investing $138 Billion into emerging technologies that includes quantum computing and research surrounding it. This project is also fully supported and backed by the government. This and the previous article shows that the leading superpower in quantum computing is undeniably China who seem to be much more interested in such technologies than the rest of the world.

Research from QuEra reveals that 51% of over 900 quantum computing academics, scientists and professionals believe that quantum computing is making faster progress than expected. Furthermore, 40% think that it will be a superior alternative to classical computers in the next 5 years. However, with such a fast development, this has caused many (31%) to become concerned that companies will not be able to adapt to the new technology similar to the current adoption of AI. According to this article, the United States claim that they are in the pole position to lead the industry with 82% in agreement.
