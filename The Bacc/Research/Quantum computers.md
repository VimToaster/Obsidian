### Analyse the current situation regarding quantum computers
- How much is being invested
- What are the recent developments

An article written by forbes last year gave some insight into the global spending on quantum computers, stating that global investments reached $55 billion, for comparison, the UK's military budget is around 60 billion for the financial year, this shows that research on quantum computers is relatively high interest, being comparable to the financial support of a top 10 military power. Furthermore, France has said that they aim to invest $2 billion and create 30,000 jobs by 2026.
