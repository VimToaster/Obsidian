Quera.com. (2025). _Research reveals quantum computing development is faster than expected_. [online] Available at: https://www.quera.com/press-releases/research-reveals-quantum-computing-development-is-faster-than-expected-set-to-become-superior-technology-within-five-years.

Objective 1a
For this objective, I aim to research general publicly available data from large companies who have shown development in quantum computers, for example Microsoft who recently a new model of quantum computer. Furthermore, from these companied, I would like to gather a possible estimate of the cost around development on quantum computers and compare it to the cost to develop classical computers. This will allow me to gain insight into the general research into such a revolutionary field and allow myself to compare it to when classical computers were invented. I would estimate that the cost on development of classical computers would've been less initially, but increased over the course of a decade, whereas quantum computing has seemed to have remained relatively niche in comparison.

Objective 1b
To analyse recent developments I will research currently published articles on the topic (e.g. in the last year), and then analyse the data by looking for common terms. However, there has also been limited development and whenever there is, it seems that it is just either Google or Microsoft as they are the two main contributors to quantum computing research. Furthermore, I can use techniques such as CRAAP analysis to assess several key areas including recency. 

Objective 2a
My aim for this task is to use a tool such as Microsoft forms or SurveyMonkey to collect primary research on my topic. For instance, questions such as "Do you know what a quantum computer is" will allow me to gain insight into general public knowledge on the subject. In addition, I can assess to what extent people's knowledge extends as the topic itself is quite vast. With this survey, I can also add a paragraph explaining what a quantum computer is (or at least the basics) and then probe the respondent to answer further questions on things such as viability or sustainability.

Objective 2b
Using information I have gathered, I can then look for research with a larger scope than my own to see if the results are similar in any way, or if there is any noticeable difference in responses. I aim to do this through tools like science articles or published studies on the topic. With this I can also grasp how quantum computing is represented in media as I presume that some people have only seen or heard of the word 'quantum' in science fiction media. I can also gain further primary research via contact with experts on the topic such as physics professors at universities who can answer questions with greater knowledge than my own.

Objective 3a
With existing information, I can analyse secondary research on not only quantum computers, but also the history of traditional computers to hopefully extrapolate data on quantum computers using similar metrics on how fast traditional computers progressed from their inception, to modern day computing. I can also use possible existing articles that have already asked this question and then use data to show how they will advance and possibly how long it will take for them to be in general use, or even if they ever will.

Objective 3b
I will use this objective as a small footnote to expand on data gathered in the precious section, mainly focusing on expanding the research on whether they can replace traditional computing, or even if they need to. I can assess the current benefits of current technology in circulation and weather quantum computers will be able to do the jobs of our current devices better or if they will always remail a relative niche only used for statistical analysis. Furthermore, the possible downsides of having general use quantum computers such as breaching current cybersecurity infrastructure as, based on their nature, they can breach almost any system in less than a second.
