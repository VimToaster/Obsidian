### Analyse the current situation regarding quantum computers
- How much is being invested
- What are the recent developments

An article written by Forbes last year gave some insight into the global spending on quantum computers, stating that global investments reached $55 billion the main contributor being China with an estimated $15 billion invested. For comparison, the UK's military budget is around 60 billion for the financial year, this shows that research on quantum computers is relatively high interest, being comparable to the financial support of a top 10 military power. Furthermore, France has said that they aim to invest $2 billion and create 30,000 jobs by 2026. The quantum computer market as a whole has an estimated worth of about $1billion.

This article goes into depth on a project announced by China where they are investing $138 Billion into emerging technologies that includes quantum computing and research surrounding it. This article states that the Chinese government has a clear interest in these emerging technologies, amongst them being quantum computing. However, the article doesn't mention exactly how much of this funding is being allocated to the quantum research departments. Though this is not to say that this is a minimal effort, any new information regarding quantum computing is exceptional.

To summarise the statistics mentioned previously, there has been a significant global effort towards research into quantum computing where the USA seems to be at the forefront of technological advancement with other countries showing clear interest. With the financial support from governments and private sources we have also seen significant progress on the development of quantum computing. This is evident as within the last year, Microsoft unveiled the first quantum computer powered by topological qubits (Basically a more accurate way to measure the qubits). Showing that the funding has been used in a clearly effective way.

### Gather insight into public opinion on quantum computers
- Send a survey to gather public insight
- Find supporting articles for secondary research

Not enough survey responses yet

This survey grants useful coverage on a survey that was used to gather information regarding how aware the general public are of quantum computing withing the UK. The survey had questioned over 1000 participants with some of the key takeaways are that 60% claim that they are 'familiar' with the concept, 5% claimed they had intimate knowledge and 31% had heard the term but knew little. Personally these statistics are shocking as from my own experiences, people tend not to be familiar with the term beyond surface level knowledge. However, statistics provided by this survey show that a majority are familiar. Though to what extent was not questioned. This study had also held workshops with 45 people where participants showed excitement about how the technology could be used in practicality with various STEM fields along with use in security and defence despite some concerns. However, all was not positive as some also showed concern for loss of jobs due to quantum empowered AI with a strong suggestion for regulation of these machines. Though despite some gripes, most agreed on the importance of the UK's development on quantum computing to avoid falling behind other nations.

The data provided by this survey shows that the general public seem to be surprisingly aware of quantum computers to a certain degree. In addition, I would like to reference the recent growth in AI and compare it to statistics provided by this survey. For instance, services such as chat-GPT and Deepseek are well known among the population, however most people do not know any more than what they provide, with no or little knowledge of how they provide the answers or what consequences these tools may have. I fear that a similar situation may arise with the advent of quantum computing, where people will use the services provided by them and not know how these machines work on a deeper level.
### Source analysis
The study as a whole has been a strikingly useful tool for gaining statistics beyond my own capabilities, allowing me to form an estimate on how much people really know on this topic. Though I do have a few gripes with the survey, one being the sample size as a population of 1000 people, though useful, may not be sufficient to form generalisations. Though on further reading on the official paper, it states that the survey had been weighted to account for a wide range of age, background, and socioeconomic position. Furthermore, the questions have no way of knowing how much people know about quantum computers on more than a surface level.

A study published by EPSRC looked into the opinion of 77 UK residents shows that in 2017, people were generally in the dark about recent developments in quantum technologies, with this and the study mentioned previously that was taken in 2024, we can estimate that over this period of time, people seem to have become more aware of such technologies in recent years. Furthermore, an interesting point of discussion brough up by the article is that the word 'quantum' seemed to be familiar, most knew very little about the topic itself. Although, the article states that 'as most participants learnt more about quantum technologies, they became increasingly curious and excited about them'. I tend to find this piece of information extremely interesting as it shows that people have a clear interest in the topic, however they lack the prior experience to know about the topic. With this, along with the previous evidence. (Oxford university article and my own survey). We can conclude that the majority of people may have heard at least the term 'quantum' from various places, along with evidence to support that people, upon hearing about the topic, seem to become more intrigued with it. Though, I propose a concern that, despite public knowledge, people may only hear the good that can come from these machines and may have a rose tinted view on what they can do, entirely ignoring the damage that these technologies may cause. This is briefly mentioned in the Oxford study, though only within people who took part in the workshop, implying prior knowledge.

### Analyse future projections by experts
- How much will they advance in the future
- Will they replace traditional computers

Research from QuEra reveals that 51% of over 900 quantum computing academics, scientists and professionals believe that quantum computing is making faster progress than expected. Furthermore, 40% think that it will be a superior alternative to classical computers in the next 5 years. However, with such a fast development, this has caused many (31%) to become concerned that companies will not be able to adapt to the new technology similar to the current adoption of AI. According to this article, the United States claim that they are in the pole position to lead the industry with 82% in agreement.

Before I analyse the next source, I would like to preface that the main problem with quantum computers is their incredibly volatile nature as, to remain in a quantum state, the qubit must not have *any* external influence. This can be caused by almost any external force, for instance if a single photon merely interacts with the qubit, it will decohere, resulting in noise. To date, it has proven extremely difficult to preserve the wavefunction (quantum state of a particle). Most articles in this study cover different methods of reducing this.
This article by StartUs has been an incredible resource to form an estimate of how quantum computing can improve in the future. It states 10 possibilities that will, together, build the lattice for the future of quantum computing. The first and possibly most impactful potential pathway is to improve the accuracy of the quantum qubits to eliminate or minimise their error rate. Pictured below in graph 1A is a plot of different quantum computing architectures and how error prone they are over a set amount of cycles. As seen below, using a 7x7 architecture drastically reduces the rate and overall amount of logical errors.

A more relevant example is the hope for wider use of Topological qubits, meaning that they can resist small disturbances. This would mean that the qubits would produce less errors overall due to a source of errors being resisted. This technology has proven its relevance with Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip which uses this technology to build a both powerful and resilient chip.

Another development is the adoption of superconducting qubits that use materials with zero electronic resistance to create an artificial atom with microwaves that can be controlled much easier than a traditional electron or photon.  The benefits of this design are that it reduces noise caused by external interference by isolating the system with the superconductor and microwaves. Recently an IBM processor named Nighthawk that uses this technology to create a system that produces less noise that allows for more accurate results that previous designs.

 Another method proposed by the article are trapped-ion systems which uses ions as an alternative to other particles as it allows the ability to control the particles precisely with lasers. Researchers claim that this method is one of the most accurate approaches with Oxford Ionics reporting the highest-ever state preparation and measurement [(SPAM) fidelities of 99.9993%](https://www.oxionics.com/announcements/oxford-ionics-sets-new-world-record-in-qubit-readout/), essentially meaning that this method produces exceedingly precise results. This is strong coherence and uniform qubit behaviour.
